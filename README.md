# Time Series Analysis of Early Childhood Education Professional Development Availability

This program takes in a file of training events approved through Montanaâ€™s Professional Development Approval System for early childhood education training, the associated hours for each training, and the date each training was offered. Shortly before this analysis was conducted, the number of required annual training hours for licensed providers doubled. The purpose of this project was to observe any trends in the data, to determine if, without intervention, the number of training hours offered would be able to meet that that requirement. My primary focus was an explanatory framework, in learning what factors have been important historically in predicting training events and training hours.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a time series analysis project for Montana State University in Fall 2018, and was used to help inform the Early Childhood Project about the availability of training for child care providers, and if that supply would meet the recent increase in demand. Included here is the dataset, R and R Markdown code, the final report, and presentation slides.
